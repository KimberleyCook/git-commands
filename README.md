# Git commands
A list of the most commonly used git commands

#### Cloning
Navigate into the folder you want to clone your project into

```
$ cd /chosen-path/
```
Then clone it

```
$ git clone [project URL]
```

##### If you want to do a shallow clone which would only get the recent commit and ignore all of it's history you can do

```
$ git clone [project URL] --depth=1
```


#### Checking git's status

Which files have changed, which branch is git using, etc

```
$ git status
```


#### Adding/committing and pushing

```
$ git add [file or directory]

$ git commit -m 'your commit message'

$ git push 
```


#### Creating a new branch
```
$ git checkout -b [branch-name]
```

#### Pushing your branch to repo for the first time
```
$ git push -u origin [branch-name]
```

#### Switching branch
```
$ git checkout [branch-name]
```

#### To see a list of all your branches 
```
$ git branch
```

#### Deleting a branch
Make sure you're not on the branch you want to delete otherwise it will not work

Delete a remote branch
```
$ git push origin --delete [branch-name]
```
Delete a local branch
```
$ git branch -d [branch-name]
```

#### This pulls your branch from origin if you do not have it locally
```
$ git checkout -b [branch-name] origin/[branch-name]
```
#### Safely merging a branch
Go onto the branch you want merge into, for example 'develop' then merge in your choosen branch for example 'kim-footer-amend' 
```
$ git merge [branch-name] --no-commit --no-ff
```
(the --no-commit does not automatically commit the branch after merging and --no-ff does not fast forward the branch you're merging into)

#### Solving conflicts
This will check out their file if you know yours is incorrect
```
$ git checkout --theirs /path-to/conflict-file 
````
This will check out your file if you know the one in the repo is outdated
```
$ git checkout --ours /path-to/conflict-file
```
Otherwise, you'll have to manually sort through them in the conflicted file. Make sure you have no `<<<` or `>>>` in your file as your conflicts live in these.

#### Reverting
If you want to delete your current changes and revert back to the previous commmit (this will lose any amends you havenâ€™t commited so only do this if you're sure)
```
$ git reset --hard
```
#### Show a log of your recent commits
```
$ git log
```
